# Developing Data Products: Slidify Presentation
---

This is the final project slidify presentation source code for the Developing Data Products course. The goal of this assignment is to build:

1. __A Shiny application__ that has widget input, ui input in `server.R`, reactive output using server calculations, and supporting documentation.

2. __A Reproducible Pitch Presentation__ that contains five slides in either Slidify or Rstudio Presenter that is pushed to and hosted on GitHub or Rpubs and contains embedded `R` code that runs.
